CoronaDelta respects your privacy and does not collect any personal data from you. All metrics are aggregated and anonymized — we have no capacity to track users on an individual basis. All data processors are listed below for transparency.

We use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com)'s privacy-friendly analytics service for aggregate visitor metrics. It does not track individuals and does not store any personal informatiofor what they do and don't collect. However, please note that we have configured this service to function regardless of whether your browser's “Do Not Track” setting is enabled in order to improve the accuracy of our analytics. Visit [All About DNT](https://allaboutdnt.com/) to learn more about “Do Not Track.”

We do not use any cookies ourselves, but we use [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) to cache and protect our services, which uses a cookie named `_cfduid` to distinguish between multiple users behind a single IP. This cookie does not allow for cross-site tracking and is not available to us. It is generally kept for no longer than 24 hours. This is required for their site protection services; consult [Cloudflare's documentation](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookies) for more information.

Our website is hosted on [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/), which has servers [located in many locations around the world](https://zeit.co/smart-cdn). We do not have any databases or other servers, since we do not store personal data.

Please direct all privacy-related questions and complaints to [privacy@coronadelta.app](mailto:privacy@coronadelta.app).
