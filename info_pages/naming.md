The coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel coronavirus. You may have heard of all these names, but which one is right?

Technically, all of them are correct. They can all be used to refer to the virus. The official names are **SARS-CoV-2** for the virus itself **COVID-19** for the disease it causes, which is usually what people refer to. “The **coronavirus**” is the most common name used in casual conversations and articles.

Below are descriptions of all the names there have been:

- **Wuhan coronavirus:** This was a popular name used by the media before official designation was assigned. It refers to where the virus originated — Wuhan.
- **Novel coronavirus:** This is still used in some places. “Novel” means “new” in Latin, so this literally means “new coronavirus.”
- **Coronavirus:** This is a simplified version of the above names, typically used in casual or repetitive contexts.
- **2019-nCoV:** Initial name from the WHO. It stands for “**n**ovel **C**or**o**na**V**irus”.
- **SARS-CoV-2:** This is the new official name of the virus, also assigned by the WHO. It references the [SARS](https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/) disease from 2003, which the new COVID-19 disease is closely related to.
- **COVID-19:** This is actually the name of the *disease* caused by the virus, not the virus itself. It stands for **C**orona**VI**rus **D**isease.

In all of the above names, the “corona” (“crown” in Latin) in “coronavirus” refers to how the virus looks when examined under a microscope:
