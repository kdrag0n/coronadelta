## Don't touch your face

## Cough into your elbows

## Stay inside

## When you absolutely must go outside...

### Wear a mask

An N95 mask is only designed to be used **once** and disposed afterwards for maximum protection. However, masks are in short supply right now due to all the demand from both . [Stanford Medicine](https://stanfordmedicine.app.box.com/v/covid19-PPE-1-1) found that the best way to disinfect a used mask is to heat it at 70Â°C for 30 minutes. Keep in mind, however, that this **has not been verified**, and you should never use a home oven for this purpose.

### Keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others

### Avoid large gatherings
