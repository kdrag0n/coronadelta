This site was made by [kdrag0n](https://kdrag0n.dev/), a passionate developer and high school student. It's meant to help everyone stay informed and make educated decisions for themselves through insightful visualizations and other information that isn't well-known.

## Why?

I felt that there were no existing sites which checked all (or even most) of the following boxes:

- Growth factor
- Collective info (with infographics)
- Clean design

That's how CoronaDelta was born — it aims to place more emphasis on less frequently mentioned but insightful stats. Growth factor is a concise way to see how things are going as compared to before, and there are several other interesting visualizations that help give some perspective on how the situation is progressing.

## Donations

I do this in my free time — donations help me stay motivated to keep improving this site. Please see the [donate](donate) page for more information. Any amount is highly appreciated!

## Open-source

## Why don't you track recoveries?

There doesn't appear to be any good sources for recovery numbers. In addition, many countries aren't keeping track of this information, so a large amount of recoveries won't be accounted for. I decided that it's better to omit this entirely than to be misleading by showing partial/incomplete data that contains a plethora of holes.

Even if all countries provide recovery numbers as well as they can, it's unlikely that medical officials have the time to keep tags on, and there isn't a good automatic reporting system yet — which means that even official numbers are most likely skewed by a significant margin. Most people will recover fine and just don't want to deal with the virus ever again, so they aren't incentivized to call in and report their status.
