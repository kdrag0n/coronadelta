## “It's just the flu.”

COVID-19 is **much worse** than the flu. The most optimistic mortality rate is still **over 10 times higher than the flu**, and it can cause significant amounts of permanent damage even after recovery. The seasonal flu doesn't warrant the formal declaration of a pandemic — this does. See the sections below for more details.

## “I'm young and healthy, so there's nothing to worry about.”

Real-world anecdotes have shown time and time again that **this is not the case**. Statistically, [the mortality rate is low](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) for young people and [critical cases are less likely](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184291/coronavirus-covid-19-young-people-sick-vulnerable-affected-severe-cases), but this does not mean that it's impossible. In fact, a significant portion of deaths in South Korea have been attributed to the young population.

25-year-old lacrosse athlete [Jack Allard](https://thebatesstudent.com/18928/news/jack-allard-16-is-in-critical-condition-due-to-covid-19/) is one example of a critical case like this.

Young people with strong immune systems are also at higher risk of damage in other organs resulting from a cytokine storm, which is when the virus causes the immune system to overreact and effectivly turn against istelf. See [Kurzgesagt's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtN-goy9VOY) for more details.

## “I'm unlikely to die, so it's not a big deal.”

The mortality rate, in its most optimistic state, is still **over 10 times the mortality rate of the flu**. See [Worldometer's comparison](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#comparison) for more details.

However, looking at mortality alone doesn't tell the full story. Many patients who recover from the virus suffer **permanent lung damage** that could have life-changing consequences, especially for athletes. [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-recovery-damage-lung-function-gasping-air-hong-kong-doctors-2020-3) reports that many patients in Hong Kong had 20-30% reduced lung capacity, and some would “gasp if they walk a bit more quickly.” Exercise can help with this, but it can never be completely recovered.

Another thing to remember is that since we are still in the middle of the pandemic, there are no solid numbers for this yet. We will have to wait until the end to get accurate numbers; see [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#correct) for a more detailed explanation.

## “There's nothing wrong with visiting my healthy friend's house.”

This might seem perfectly safe, but you can never be completely sure that nobody involved is infected. [Many cases never show symptoms](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00822-x) (in other words, they are asymptomatic) — estimates are between 20-60%.

This endangers those around you. Please be considerate of others and stay home — you can still connect online. *Physical* distancing does not imply full-on *social* distancing. Your one-day bout of in-person fun could end up taking someone else's life, but there's nothing wrong with doing anything remotely!

## “Masks don't help, so you shouldn't use them.”

**Masks will drastically reduce your chances of catching the virus**. They are not perfect, and should not be treated as such, but the benefits are clear.

That being said, **do not hoard masks** — medical professionals and healthcare workers need them more than you do. Hospitals around the globe are [running low on personal protective equipment (PPE)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/coronavirus-yankees-ponchos.html), which includes masks, gloves, and other protective items. Healthcare workers' lives are at stake because of this. Don't contribute to making the storage even worse than it already is.

If absolutely necessary, you can use clothing or make your own mask. In fact, making your own masks is a great way to support your local hospitals if they accept homemade masks — many do! They may not be as effective as N95 masks, but having *something* is much better than nothing at all. It's an easy way to contribute back to your community in the midst of a crisis. Just call up or email your local hospitals — some states (such as New York) are also accepting PPE donations at a larger scale.

## “I don't feel sick or don't have X symptom, so I don't have coronavirus.”

Symptoms are on a sliding scale, and none are 100% guaranteed. In fact, some people can carry and spread the virus without showing any signs of being sick at all! It is estimated that between 20-60% of infected people never show symptoms — see this [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00822-x) article for more details.
