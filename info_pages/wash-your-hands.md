You should always wash your hands often and thoroughly, but it's especially important in the midst of a pandemic. Here's how to minimize your chance of getting coronavirus by washing your hands correctly.

## 1. Wet your hands

This will make the soap slippery, which helps it work better and catch all potential virus particles.

## 2. Apply soap

Soap is very effective at killing this virus because it essentially takes the virus apart.

## 3. Start scrubbing

Thorough scrubbing is important, since virus particles are very small and like to stick anywhere.

You should scrub for at least 20 seconds. As a rule of thumb, it takes about the same amount of time to sing the ABCs.

## 4. Scrub between fingers
