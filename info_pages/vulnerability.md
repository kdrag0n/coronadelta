**Everybody is vulnerable to the coronavirus.** However, some populations are at higher risk than others.

## Gender

## Age

## Pre-existing conditions

## Blood type

According to the [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3075567/people-blood-type-may-be-more-vulnerable-coronavirus-china-study), people with the A blood type are the most vulnerable, and people with blood type O are the least vulnerable. However, this does not mean that you should give up if you have A blood or ignore it if you have O â€” nobody is completely resistant, and nobody is guaranteed to get the virus. It is important to take the standard precautions.
