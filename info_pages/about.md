This site was made by [kdrag0n](https://kdrag0n.dev/), a passionate developer and high school student. It's meant to help everyone stay informed and make educated decisions for themselves through insightful visualizations and other information that isn't well-known.

## Why?

I felt that there were no existing sites which checked all (or even most) of the following boxes:

- Growth factor
- Collective info (with infographics)
- Clean design

That's how CoronaDelta was born — it aims to place more emphasis on less frequently mentioned but insightful stats. Growth factor is a concise way to see how things are going as compared to before, and there are several other interesting visualizations that help give some perspective on how the situation is progressing.

## Donations

I do this in my free time — donations help me stay motivated to keep improving this site. Please see the [donate](donate) page for more information. Any amount is highly appreciated!
